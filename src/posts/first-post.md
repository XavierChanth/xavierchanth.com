I currently work at a startup called [Atsign](https://atsign.com), mainly
working on our product suite called [NoPorts](https://noports.com).
Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work alongside some amazing
colleagues. I've been given the privilege of receiving one-on-one mentorship from
numerous individuals with extensive experience across a variety of subdomains.

As a result of this mentorship, and my aggressive passion for learning, I've
been able to grow as a software engineer exceptionally fast.
This blog is a place for me to formally share all that I've learned and will
continue to learn. I will also discuss my own personal insights and the events
and reasoning that have lead to them.
